# Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

# There is a cycle in a linked list 
# if there is some node in the list 
# that can be reached again by continuously 
# following the next pointer.

# Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. 
# Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

# Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
